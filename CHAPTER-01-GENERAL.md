# NEC 2026 – Chapter 1: General

**Chapters 1 through 4 apply generally to all installations.**

---

## Article 100 – Definitions

**Purpose:** Establishes the definitions of terms used throughout the NEC.

**Key Definitions:**
- **Accessible** (as applied to equipment): Admitting close approach; not guarded by locked doors, elevation, or other effective means.
- **Accessible** (as applied to wiring methods): Capable of being removed or exposed without damaging the building structure or finish.
- **Ampacity:** The current, in amperes, that a conductor can carry continuously under the conditions of use without exceeding its temperature rating.
- **Branch Circuit:** The circuit conductors between the final overcurrent device protecting the circuit and the outlet(s).
- **Conduit Body:** A separate portion of a conduit or tubing system that provides access through a removable cover(s).
- **Feeder:** All circuit conductors between the service equipment, the source of a separately derived system, or other power supply source and the final branch-circuit overcurrent device.
- **Grounded:** Connected to earth or to some conducting body that serves in place of the earth.
- **Grounded Conductor:** A system or circuit conductor that is intentionally grounded.
- **Grounding Electrode:** A conducting object through which a direct connection to earth is established.
- **Service:** The conductors and equipment for delivering electric energy from the serving utility to the wiring system of the premises served.
- **Service Equipment:** The necessary equipment, usually consisting of a circuit breaker(s) or switch(es) and fuse(s) and their accessories, connected to the load end of service conductors.

## Article 110 – General Requirements for Electrical Installations

**Purpose:** Covers general requirements for examination and approval, installation and use, access to electrical equipment, tunnels, enclosures, and working space.

### Key Sections:

**110.26 – Spaces About Electrical Equipment**
- **110.26(A)(1) – Depth of Working Space:** Minimum 3 ft (900 mm) for equipment up to 600V
- **110.26(A)(2) – Width of Working Space:** Minimum 30 in (750 mm) or width of equipment, whichever is greater
- **110.26(A)(3) – Height of Working Space:** Minimum 6.5 ft (2.0 m)

**110.26(C) – Entrance and Access to Working Space**
- At least one entrance of sufficient area (minimum 24 in × 6.5 ft)

**110.14 – Electrical Connections**
- Temperature limitations
- Torque requirements (see Annex I)

## Article 120 – Branch-Circuit, Feeder, and Service Load Calculations

**Purpose:** Provides the requirements for calculating branch-circuit, feeder, and service loads.

### Key Sections:

**120.40 – General**
- Load calculations shall be based on the connected load

**120.42 – Branch Circuits**
- Continuous loads: 125% of continuous load
- Noncontinuous loads: 100% of load

**120.50 – Feeders**
- Feeder load = Sum of branch circuit loads with demand factors applied

**120.60 – Services**
- Service load calculation per Article 220

## Article 130 – Energy Management Systems

**Purpose:** Covers the installation and operation of energy management systems that monitor and control electrical loads.

### Key Sections:

**130.1 – Scope**
- Applies to systems that automatically control electrical loads

**130.2 – Definitions**
- **Energy Management System:** A system that monitors and controls electrical loads

**130.10 – Load Management**
- Systems shall not reduce the ampacity below the required load

## Study Notes

### Critical for Examination:

| Topic | Key Points |
|-------|------------|
| **Definitions (Art. 100)** | Memorize: Accessible, Ampacity, Branch Circuit, Feeder, Service, Grounded |
| **Working Space (110.26)** | 3 ft depth, 30 in width, 6.5 ft height |
| **Load Calculations (Art. 120)** | Continuous = 125%, Noncontinuous = 100% |

### Common Exam Questions:

1. **What is the minimum working space depth for 480V equipment?**
   - Answer: 3 ft (900 mm) per 110.26(A)(1)

2. **How is a continuous load calculated for conductor sizing?**
   - Answer: 125% of continuous load per 120.42

3. **Define "Accessible" as applied to equipment.**
   - Answer: Admitting close approach; not guarded by locked doors, elevation, or other effective means
